trl-1  1 - basic principles observed                                  Scientific research has led to observation and reports of basic principles which has evolved to applied research and development.
trl-2  2 - technology concept formulated                              Practical applications for the observed basic physical principles is found and reported.
trl-3  3 - experimental proof of concept                              The most critical functions of the new technology is validated by using both analytical and experimental methods.
trl-4  4 - technology validated in lab                                The concept is tested to assure that the technical elements can be integrated together and achieve the desired performance, at a component and/or breadboard level.
trl-5  5 - technology validated in relevant environment               The components making up the concept is tested individually in realistic environment.
trl-6  6 - technology demonstrated in relevant environment            A model or prototype of the concept, not individual components, is tested in a relevant environment.
trl-7  7 - system prototype demonstration in operational environment  A prototype is tested in the environment in which the final product will operate, e.g. in the original NASA framework this meant to test the technology in space.
trl-8  8 - system complete and qualified                              The technology is built to the specifications of the final product and is tested in the operational environment alongside all systems it will interact with.
trl-9  9 - actual system proven in operational environment            At this level the all technology development has been completed and the technology is performing as intended in the real-world environment.

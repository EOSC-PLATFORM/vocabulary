   1 - basic principles observed                                  Scientific research has led to observation and reports of basic principles which has evolved to applied research and development.                                    trl-1
   2 - technology concept formulated                              Practical applications for the observed basic physical principles is found and reported.                                                                             trl-2
   3 - experimental proof of concept                              The most critical functions of the new technology is validated by using both analytical and experimental methods.                                                    trl-3
   4 - technology validated in lab                                The concept is tested to assure that the technical elements can be integrated together and achieve the desired performance, at a component and/or breadboard level.  trl-4
   5 - technology validated in relevant environment               The components making up the concept is tested individually in realistic environment.                                                                                trl-5
   6 - technology demonstrated in relevant environment            A model or prototype of the concept, not individual components, is tested in a relevant environment.                                                                 trl-6
   7 - system prototype demonstration in operational environment  A prototype is tested in the environment in which the final product will operate, e.g. in the original NASA framework this meant to test the technology in space.    trl-7
   8 - system complete and qualified                              The technology is built to the specifications of the final product and is tested in the operational environment alongside all systems it will interact with.         trl-8
   9 - actual system proven in operational environment            At this level the all technology development has been completed and the technology is performing as intended in the real-world environment.                          trl-9

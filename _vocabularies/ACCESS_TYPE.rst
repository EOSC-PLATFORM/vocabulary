   Remote    Resources are delivered remotely with the use of a physical infrastructure. The user is able to remotely work with the physical RI without the need of physical presence.  access_type-remote
   Virtual   The Resource is delivered through a virtual infrastructure that the use may access virtually through the web or an intranet.                                               access_type-virtual

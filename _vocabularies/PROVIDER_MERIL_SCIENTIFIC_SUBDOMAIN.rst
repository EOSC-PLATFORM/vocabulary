   In Situ Marine/Freshwater Observatories                                               Platforms and sensor technologies deployed in situ to collect environmental data (including physical, chemical and biological observations) in support of aquatic environmental research and management activities. These facilities, including marine/freshwater research centres, provide a base for trans-disciplinary research and training, with access to marine and freshwater field sites, and equipment (including research vessels that may carry large exchangeable underwater equipment/instruments ) for survey and experimental opportunities and often supporting environmental observations and the collection of long-term time series data sets (a.o. on biodiversity). Typical equipment includes: Buoys; Argo; gliders; autonomous underwater vehicles; remotely operated vehicle (Victor); Tide gauges; deep sea laboratories. Ship-time for stock assessments, polar supply, naval research, and educational courses and non- academic research are not considered in this context. For this inventory the atmospheric measurement facilities are kept as a separate subdomain. This implies that some marine research centres will also fall under this subdomain if they host an atmospheric measurement site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-earth_and_environmental_sciences-in_situ_marine_freshwater_observatories                                                provider_meril_scientific_domain-earth_and_environmental_sciences

   Collections                                                                           Sets of often unique objects and items of different types collected usually to be exhibited. Collections normally include a collecting policy for new acquisitions, so only objects and items in certain categories and of a certain quality are accepted into the collection. Objects in a collection are normally catalogued, traditionally in a card index, but nowadays this is being replaced by computerized database also for physical collections. These type of RIs are particularly relevant for the humanities, which often deal with the study of unique artefacts, but they can be relevant for other domains, such as social sciences, life and environmental sciences.

   Conceptual Models                                                                     Explicit formalisations that map a concept to its intended semantics. Conceptual models are adopted in every research domain (e.g. economic models, mathematical models). In the humanities, however, some conceptual models have developed into RIs indispensable to structure a certain knowledge domain, such as is the case for thesauri and taxonomies (also very much used in life sciences) which have a long tradition in supporting analytical efforts especially in linguistics. Increasingly, digital models built around conceptual ontologies and networks are being developed for modelling specific research domain or for cross-referencing purposes in the Humanities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-humanities_and_arts-conceptual_models                                                                                   provider_meril_scientific_domain-humanities_and_arts

The term database applies to the data and their supporting data structures. The utilisation of databases is spread across all scientific disciplines. Databases are therefore RIs relevant to all scientific domains. Databases in the form of structured meta-data as well as analytical data organised usually within a relational model have been extensively developed as RIs in the Humanities with increasing uptake in all its disciplines: Archaeology, Anthropology and Ethnology Databases, Arts & Art History Databases, History Databases, Digitised Manuscript Databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-humanities_and_arts-databases                                                                                           provider_meril_scientific_domain-humanities_and_arts

   Repositories                                                                          Locations for storage of often unique objects and items of different nature, in general for preservation purposes. Repositories not only have the function to store objects and items but they also guarantee access for future retrieval and study. This type of RI in its general definition is relevant to all scientific domains (for instance as far as physical or virtual facility for the deposit of academic publications such as academic journal articles are concerned); however, some humanities disciplines strongly rely on specific repositories for its analysis.

   Research Archives                                                                     Accounting normally for organised sets of unpublished and almost always unique historical records, or the physical place they are located, archives contain primary source documents (texts, maps, pictures etc.) in physical but also increasingly digital form (e.g. text archives structured in databases) that have accumulated over the course of an individual or organisation's lifetime. In general, archives consist of records that have been selected for permanent or long-term preservation on grounds of their enduring cultural, historical, or evidentiary value. Archives are thus particularly relevant to the Humanities, chiefly to historians but also to many other Humanities researchers dealing with primary sources of various kinds. A scientific discipline called archival science, dedicated to the study and practice of organising, preserving, and providing access to information and materials in archives, has established itself within the Humanities: History Archives, Literature and Text Archives.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-humanities_and_arts-research_archives                                                                                   provider_meril_scientific_domain-humanities_and_arts
   Research Bibliographies                                                               Large-scale systematic lists of books and other works such as journal articles, reference and access resources. They can be physical publications (i.e. bound volumes) or digital (indexes and catalogues usually in the form of databases). They can be generally divided into enumerative bibliography, which results in an overview of publications in a particular subdomain, and analytical, or critical, bibliography, which studies the production of research material (in the form of books as well as other formats, including recordings, motion pictures, videos, graphic objects, databases, CD-ROMs and websites). As a bibliography can be produced in any field, it could be considered a transversal subdomain; however it is Humanities research especially that has traditionally relied on such tools to systematise its fields of enquiry – spanning centuries of relevant publications for many humanities disciplines – and circumscribe its research domain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-humanities_and_arts-research_bibliographies                                                                             provider_meril_scientific_domain-humanities_and_arts
   Research Libraries                                                                    Traditionally, large collections of books, or the place in which the collection is housed. However, the term library has extended its meaning to refer to any collection, including digital sources, resources, and services. The collections can be of print, audio, and visual materials in numerous formats, including maps, prints, documents, microform (microfilm/microfiche), CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, video games, e-books, audiobooks and many other electronic resources. A research library is a collection of useful material for research use. A library is organised for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual. In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organising information and at interpreting information needs. Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources. They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analysing tremendous amounts of information with a variety of digital tools. Libraries are valuable to all scientific domains; however, they are of specific relevance to Humanities research which relies on access to historical and rare collections of unique artefacts (e.g. primary sources such as ancient manuscripts) and other sources to study those artefacts and works (secondary and tertiary sources) usually held within libraries and otherwise hardly accessible. A scientific discipline called library and information science, an interdisciplinary or multidisciplinary field dedicated to the analysis, collection, organisation, classification, manipulation, preservation, retrieval and dissemination of information resources, has established itself at the crossroads between social sciences, humanities and computer sciences. Historically, library science has also included archival science.  provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-humanities_and_arts-research_libraries                                                                                  provider_meril_scientific_domain-humanities_and_arts

   Mathematics Centres of Competence                                                     Mathematics centres of competence develop mathematical models for applications in all sciences and engineering, including social sciences, and medicine. They analyse the models, develop and implement algorithms for the simulation of the models as well as for the optimization and control of the involved processes. They provide transversal competences which allow transferring concepts and methods from one specific science to another and they also provide consulting concerning the use of methods and their implementation for specific applications. When needed, they generate the basic mathematical theory that is needed to perform the described tasks.

These type of RIs are particularly acute to the social sciences, which often rely on the aggregation of longitudinal data, and to the humanities, which often rely on preservation, but they can be relevant for other domains, particularly, the life and environmental sciences and the medical sciences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-social_sciences-data_archives_data_repositories_and_collections                                                         provider_meril_scientific_domain-social_sciences
   Data mining & Analysis (Methodological) Centres, including statistical analysis       Centres of expertise or methodological resources for extracting patterns from large data sets by combining methods from statistics and artificial intelligence. These RIs enable researchers to overcome the challenge of working with increasingly larger data-sets. Data-mining and statistical techniques populate every scientific domain but what counts as data is domain specific. Therefore, this subdomain should be understood as specific to social sciences because it refers to data in the social sciences.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 provider_meril_scientific_subdomain-social_sciences-data_mining_and_analysis_centres                                                                        provider_meril_scientific_domain-social_sciences
